    <title>Hard Life</title>
    <description>
    A girl is fighting for her place in a hostile world, against overwhelming 
    odds. Without help, she'll be lost.<br/>
    I made this as a "quickshot" adventure, set in the world of the "Blue Planet"
    game by Biohazard. Character sheets have been provided for the first edition
    of the game, however "Blue Planet" has since been republished by Fantasy 
    Flight games with new rules.<br/>
    The scenario contains hints at child abuse, use this at your own discretion.

    <title>Peaceful Relations</title>
    <description>
    Remote farms are ruthlessly attacked by unknown raiders. Can the slaughter
    be stopped before an open war breaks out.<br/>
    These are notes and character descriptions for an adventure that I run
    as part of a "Deadlands - Lost Colony" game. The scenario could be adapted
    to almost any wild west/outback setting.

    <title>A history of the Dark Ages</title>
    <description>
    A short timeline of events in medieval Europe. I made this for a "Vampire"
    campaign, but it's all "real" stuff and may be used for any game. No
    warranties for historical correctness, though...

    <title>gameXF - a roleplaying XML format</title>
    <description>
    This was an attempt to create a generic XML format to store roleplaying 
    information. The package contains an XML schema, XSL Transformation 
    stylesheets and sample data (character descriptions from a "Feng Shui"
    and an "Unknown Armies" campaign). I doubt that this project will go
    any further, but you may use the ideas if you like.<br/>
    You'll need an XSLT engine to do the stylesheet transformations.

    <title>LIRP-Zubehör (German language)</title>
    <description>
    Dies sind "Charakterb&#246;gen" f&#252;r ein LIRP (Life Indoor Roleplaying 
    Game) das wir auf einer Party durchgeführt haben. Jeder Gast erhielt
    einen solchen Zettel als Characterbeschreibung. Leider habe ich keine
    Aufschrieb des "Drumherums" und der restlichen Charactere mehr.
