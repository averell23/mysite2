    <h4>misconceptions about copyrights</h4>
        There are still many misconceptions about copyrights and trademarks and
        how they apply to the Internet. I pick some of the most popular to give
        a quick overview of the topic.
    <h2>If it's on the web it's free to use</h2>
        <p> 
        No matter if the material is on the Internet, in a museum or a
        book: You must <b>always</b> obtain the author's permission to
        re-publish his work. (It's usually o.k. to make copies for private use,
        but private use does <b>not</b> include using it for your own pages.) 
        </p>
        <h2>I can use any material if my page is not commercial</h2>
        <p> 
        It doesn't matter if your page is "commercial" or not. If you
        publish someone else's work you <b>always</b> need the author's
        permission. 
        </p>
    <h2>I need permission to link to other pages and must not "deep link"</h2>
        <p> 
        This isn't really a copyright issue, but at least in Germany you
        may "deep link" to your heart's desire. The German supreme court
        (Bundesgerichtshof) decided that as long as a page is publicly
        available on the net you may link to it, whether the author likes it or
        not. 
        </p>
    <h2>I must not use a trademark without the owner's permission</h2>
        <p> 
        While you must not use someone's trademark if it is your own (e.g.
        to endorse the sale of your product), you may of course use any
        trademark for describing the product. (e.g. when you write about
        Microsoft Word, Microsoft cannot stop you from calling their product
        "Microsoft Word"). 
        </p>
        <p> 
        In the European Union you also have the right to use a trademark to
        declare compatibility ("This program runs under Windows XP"). 
        </p>
        <p> 
        You also don't need disclaimers or other vodoo like "(tm)" signs
        (at least not in Germany). 
        </p>
    <h2>If I change something, I own it.</h2>
        <p> 
        By changing an existing work you create a new one. That doesn't
        void the rights of the original author, however. You still need his
        permission to distribute the new work 
        </p>
    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
        <p> 
        This is also no copyright question. However, it has become a
        widespread practice to use "Disclaimers" to avoid legal troubles. These
        things usually fulfil the same function as magical incantations and are
        equally reliable. Almost all of them have no legal value whatsoever.
        (Again, this is true for Germany). 
        </p>
        <p> 
        Simply put: An illegal act doesn't become legal by you willing (or
        disclaiming) it so. 
        </p>
    <h2>Copyrights protect ideas</h2>
        <p> 
        A copyright doesn't protect an idea, but only the <i>expression</i>
        of an idea. The idea itself (e.g. "a book about people falling in
        love") can <b>not</b> be protected.
